**Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.** - *David Allen* 

**If a young man gets married, starts a family, and spends the rest of his life working at a soul-destroying job, he is held up as an example of virtue and responsibility. The other type of man, living only for himself, working only for himself, doing first one thing and then another simply because he enjoys it and because he has to keep only himself, sleeping where and when he wants, and facing woman when he meets her, on equal terms and not as one of a million slaves, is rejected by society. The free, unshackled man has no place in its midst.** - *Esther Vilar* 

**I don't like work--no man does--but I like what is in the work--the chance to find yourself. Your own reality--for yourself not for others--what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.** - *Joseph Conrad* 

**In keeping silent about evil, in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousand fold in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers, we are not simply protecting their trivial old age, we are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.** - *Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn* 

**… What about the main thing in life, all its riddles?  If you want, I'll spell it out for you right now.  Do not pursue what is illusionary -property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night.  Live with a steady superiority over life -don't be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn't last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing.  It is enough if you don't freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don't claw at your insides.  If your back isn't broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes can see, if both ears hear, then whom should you envy?  And why?  Our envy of others devours us most of all.  Rub your eyes and purify your heart -and prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well.  Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted on their memory.** - *Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn* 

**Only those who decline to scramble up the career ladder are interesting as human beings. Nothing is more boring than a man with a career.** - *Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn* 

**Bless you prison, bless you for being in my life.  For there, lying upon the rotting prison straw, I came to realize that the object of life is not prosperity as we are made to believe, but the maturity of the human soul.** - *Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn* 

**And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.** - *Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn * 

**Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.** - *Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn* 

**At what point, then, should one resist? When one's belt is taken away? When one is ordered to face into a corner? When one crosses the threshold of one's home? An arrest consists of a series of incidental irrelevancies, of a multitude of things that do not matter, and there seems no point in arguing about one of them individually...and yet all these incidental irrelevancies taken together implacably constitute the arrest.   ** - *Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn* 

**One man who stopped lying could bring down a tyranny.** - *Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn* 

**And he who is not sufficiently courageous to defend his soul — don’t let him be proud of his ‘progressive’ views, and don’t let him boast that he is an academician or a people’s artist, a distinguished figure or a general. Let him say to himself: I am a part of the herd and a coward. It’s all the same to me as long as I’m fed and kept warm.** - *Alexander Solzhenitsyn* 

**In a fraudulent pseudoscience, there is no incentive at all for uncovering error, because the only result of a successful dissent is to destroy your job and those of your peers.** - *Mencius Moldbug* 

**Clearly, only very unequal intellectual and moral standing could justify having equality imposed, whether the people want it or not, as Dworkin suggests, and only very unequal power would make it possible.** - *Thomas Sowell* 

**practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation.** - *Thomas Sowell* 

**Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.** - *Albert Camus* 

**Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?** - *Albert Camus* 

**Live to the point of tears.** - *Albert Camus* 

**But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.** - *Albert Camus* 

**Always go too far, because that's where you'll find the truth** - *Albert Camus* 

**There is not love of life without despair about life.** - *Albert Camus* 

**I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.** - *Albert Camus* 

**Some people talk in their sleep. Lecturers talk while other people sleep** - *Albert Camus* 

**I would rather live my life as if there is a god and die to find out there isn't, than live my life as if there isn't and die to find out there is.** - *Albert Camus* 

**There is scarcely any passion without struggle.** - *Albert Camus* 

**Idleness is fatal only to the mediocre.** - *Albert Camus*
