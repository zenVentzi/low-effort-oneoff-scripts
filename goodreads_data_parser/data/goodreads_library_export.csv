We create a lot of obstacles in our heads and rebel against reality unnecessarily. We've been taught that if it's not hard we're probably slacking off, or we're not making optimal progress and things of that nature. That if you lay down for a day your muscles will fall off. We've been taught that the path of most resistance is the right path, without stopping to think that there are way too many paths with a lot of resistance and the majority of them are not the right ones. And we need to soften up in order to assess where we need to be hard at work. <br/><br/>He still uses a lot of words that the new-agey type of people use but while he does that, he also uses real-world examples with real-world problems which makes me think that he's had real-life experience, and has seen the harshness and has nevertheless written this book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
