9130604,Esther Vilar,The Manipulated Man,0953096424,"If a young man gets married, starts a family, and spends the rest of his<br/>life working at a soul-destroying job, he is held up as an example of virtue<br/>and responsibility. The other type of man, living only for himself, working<br/>only for himself, doing first one thing and then another simply because he<br/>enjoys it and because he has to keep only himself, sleeping where and when<br/>he wants, and facing woman when he meets her, on equal terms and not as<br/>one of a million slaves, is rejected by society. The free, unshackled man has<br/>no place in its midst.","marriage, men, responsibility",12,2
18287,Joseph Conrad,Heart of Darkness,1892295490,"I don't like work--no man does--but I like what is in the work--the chance to find yourself.

214345,Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn,The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956 (Abridged),0060007761,"In keeping silent about evil, in burying it so deep within us that no sign of it appears on the surface, we are implanting it, and it will rise up a thousand fold in the future. When we neither punish nor reproach evildoers, we are not simply protecting their trivial old age, we are thereby ripping the foundations of justice from beneath new generations.","evil, injustice, justice, morality",516,4
415498,Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956 (Abridged),0060007761,"… What about the main thing in life, all its riddles?  If you want, I'll spell it out for you right now.  Do not pursue what is illusionary -property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night.  Live with a steady superiority over life -don't be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn't last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing.  It is enough if you don't freeze in the cold and if thirst and hunger don't claw at your insides.  If your back isn't broken, if your feet can walk, if both arms can bend, if both eyes can see, if both ears hear, then whom should you envy?  And why?  Our envy of others devours us most of all.  Rub your eyes and purify your heart -and prize above all else in the world those who love you and who wish you well.  Do not hurt them or scold them, and never part from any of them in anger; after all, you simply do not know: it may be your last act before your arrest, and that will be how you are imprinted on their memory.",living-life,311,5

34738,"Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn ",The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956 (Abridged),0060007761,"And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.",,194,8

138187,Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn,The Gulag Archipelago 1918–1956 (Abridged),0060007761,"At what point, then, should one resist? When one's belt is taken away? When one is ordered to face into a corner? When one crosses the threshold of one's home? An arrest consists of a series of incidental irrelevancies, of a multitude of things that do not matter, and there seems no point in arguing about one of them individually...and yet all these incidental irrelevancies taken together implacably constitute the arrest.   ",,55,10

10882942,Alexander Solzhenitsyn,Archipiélago Gulag,,"And he who is not sufficiently courageous to defend his soul — don’t let him be proud of his ‘progressive’ views, and don’t let him boast that he is an academician or a people’s artist, a distinguished figure or a general. Let him say to himself: I am a part of the herd and a coward. It’s all the same to me as long as I’m fed and kept warm.","courage, cowardice, herd-mentality, progressivism, soul",4,12

He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile.
